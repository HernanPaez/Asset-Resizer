# asset-resizer
## About
An iOS Asset resizer made with Go. This application generates all assets sizes from one single image.

* If you provide an @2x image it will generate @3x and @1x images
* If you provide an @3x image it will generate @2x and @1x images


## Installing 
Unless you're a developer, you probably want a binary you can run. [Download](https://github.com/HernanPaez/asset-resizer/releases) the latest release for macOS.
It should work on Linux and Windows platforms by building it from source. I will try to generate build for these platforms soon.
