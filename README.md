# asset-resizer
## About
An iOS Asset resizer made with Go  

## Installing 
Unless you're a developer, you probably want a binary you can run. [Download](https://github.com/HernanPaez/asset-resizer/releases) the latest release for macOS.
It should work on Linux and Windows platforms by building it from source. I will try to generate build for these platforms soon.
